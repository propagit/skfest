On average we can serve one customer every 15-30 seconds at events. We have catered for some of the biggest events in Melbourne including Flemington Racecourse, Melbourne NYE (MCG), Caulfield Cup, White Night, Laneway Festival.\n\nOur motto is "To serve restaurant quality food fast and at an affordable price."\n\nBelow is a insert from a recent article about our business and chef to give you a insight about sliders on tyres.\n\nShould you happen to see a large food truck displaying the phrase “awesome street food” parked on the streets of Melbourne, do yourself a favour, take a pitstop and indulge in one of their special sliders.\n\nMelbournians are going nuts for sliders – mini burgers in brioche with creative fillings that are designed to leave you licking your lips and wanting more. New food truck Sliders on Tyres promises to take the slider concept to the next level, and doesn’t fail in doing so.\n\nIts Owner and chef, Owen Scungio, has one main priority: that people find the truck “on a weekly basis and be excited by new flavours and menu items.” He thoughtfully designs unique creations prepared with the finest ingredients. “I love to get down to the markets on a weekly basis and just explore.” he says. “My mind goes crazy with ideas and it evolves from there.”\n\nHaving worked in some of the best restaurants across Australia, including Waterfront A.C.T, Parliament House A.C.T and the highly acclaimed local restaurant, Vue de Monde, Scungio knows a thing or two about good food. “To me, the slider is something that you can really dress up and put some creative flair into.” Scungio tells us, “The vision I had for the truck, what we are about, is restaurant quality food in an accessible form.”\n\nAccessible? Most certainly. Creative? Absolutely! Think tender pulled chicken pieces marinated in a sweet hoi sin sauce on a soft, warm bun.

We provide fresh quality foods, at competitive prices with an emphasis on waste wise initiatives. \n\nFood Van\nThe provision of hot foods is achieved with our custom built Gourmet Food Van. The size of this operation (4.4 m frontage x 2m depth, one 15 Amp outlet) allows us to cater for our respective clients efficiently and professionally without the need to take up a large amount of valuable space. Such foods as chicken souvlaki (wraps), chicken schnitzel burgers, beef hamburgers, hot chips and hot dogs can be provided with minimal fuss.\nWith digital signage, a vibrant vinyl wrap exterior, and quality appliances the Food Van is a professional outlet that provides quality fresh foods with minimal wait times. If power is unavailable, our silent generator can also be utilized.\n\nIce Cream Vans\nCerminara Catering own and operate two mobile Ice Cream Vans. The Ice Cream Vans (4m frontage x 2.0m depth) provide the finest quality traditional Italian Gelati (98% fat free and gluten free) and Soft Serve Ice Cream. Both vans are extremely popular in finer weather and are a drawcard for children of all ages.  Both vans are operated using one 10 Amp power outlet. Again, if power is unavailable the vans operate via our silent generator\n\nHealthy Option\nOur business does provide the public with an opportunity to choose a healthy food option. Our chicken souvlaki wraps and beef burgers are grilled and contain fresh lettuce, tomato and light cheese. Our Italian Gelati is 98% fat free and gluten free. However, the patrons do have an opportunity to indulge in favourite past time foods such as hot chips and hot dogs. It is noted that all our fried food is cooked in 100% cholesterol free canola oil.\n\nRegistrations and certificates\nThe business is registered at the City of Hobson’s Bay Council in accordance with the Food Act 1984. Pursuant to this legislation, our business has in place a mandatory Food Safety Program which guarantees the quality and freshness of our products served to the public. Our Hot Food Van also has an approved gas permit/authority from the Office of Gas and Safety, which is trying to regulate our industry and prevent non complying food vans from operating.

As a result, our team of employees have completed modules in INT 8. Occupational Hygiene, BBC 11. Food Hygiene, which are nationally accredited and recognized. Our Food Safety Supervisor has the necessary Level 1 and Level 2 certificates for undertaking such a role. \n\nWaste Wise Initiatives\nThe business also understands the importance of considering the environment when trading. As such all packaging used in our business meet Waste Wise Event guidelines. Our business has taken further initiatives with regard to our catering wares adopting 100% compostable and biodegradable catering wares. Although a little more expensive then recyclable packaging, it is inevitable that such packaging is the way of the future in combating future environmental issues.\n\nOur business and our clients\nAnother important aspect of our business, which has contributed to our success, is the diversity, quality and pricing of our products. Cerminara Catering is a complete family business. Minimal overheads, allows us to provide quality products at very competitive prices.

Note: i am in the process of purchasing marque and equipment, i will send a picture of it all set up well before festival.

The mashed potato dough is pan fried (to order) in clarified butter, and topped with a range of toppings.  Each serve is two pieces, making it easy for patrons to share, and great value.\n\nSavoury Langos  - Freshly crushed Garlic, Sour Cream and our special blend of 4 grated cheeses. \n\nTraditional Langos – Garlic and salt \n\nSmoked Salmon Langos – Sour cream mixed with fresh dill and capers, and then topped with artisan cold smoked, hand cut “Ashmores” Tasmanian Salmon,\n\nSmoked Salmon Crackling – A very special “Special” - Better than pork crackling.  Cooked to order. Made from smoked salmon, served with a dip of sour cream, dill and capers. – Just amazing!!!\n\nSweet Langos – Grated dark organic chocolate mixed with ground roasted hazelnuts, and topped with fresh whipped cream.\n\nFresh Fruit Langos – Langos folded Calzone style, filled with fresh seasonal berries (probably raspberry) and topped with fresh whipped cream\n\nOrganic Spiced Hungarian Hot Chocolate – Grated dark organic chocolate, our blend of Hungarian spices melted into organic milk, topped with fresh whipped cream.\n\nPreviously we’ve had very successful stalls at the Queen Vic Winter Night Market in 2013 and 2014, and the Brunswick Folks Festival 2014.  We have a permanent stall at Prahran Market that has been operating since September 2013, where we do a more extensive traditional Hungarian menu. You are welcome to contact Spiros or Josh at QVM for a reference.  \n\nStreatrader – Statement of Trade will be lodged on success of our application..

Our Instagram is @featherdesigns\n\nFeather headdresses\nOur handmade headdresses range from simple to extravagant, feminine to masculine. We make them using a large variety of feathers, as well as leather, ribbon, chain, crystals and beads to name a few. They are extremely easy to wear (and dance in) as we use special clips and tying techniques to secure the headdresses. I make them specifically for festivals and ensure they are sturdy, strong and washable. All designs are unique and we do not copy cultures, tribes and traditions. Price range: $50-$350. \n\nFeather Hatbands\nOur saying, ''put a feather in that cap!''. Our headdresses have been greatly received but there was a gap in the market for those who love their hats, or who want to adorn their hats with feathers. We make simple and extravagant hat bands to suits different tastes, genders and hats! They suit fedoras, top hats, 1970s boho hats and many more. They have been very popular with men. Average price $35\n\nFeather Hair Extensions \nWe hand dye and bundle different types of feathers into different bundles and combinations as well as selling them as singles too. We have around 50+ different options from long to short, feather braids, single feathers to bundles of 5, natural colours and bright tie dyed colours. Our range changes depending on the season and new creations we create. We install them at our stalls for the customers. They last 3-6 months and can be washed, curled, straightened and blow dried. Over the years we have been designing different types of feather hair extensions and accessories to suit different people, tastes and hair types. They are loved by all ages and genders too. General price range: $10-40\n\nJewellery\nOur handmade jewellery consists of feather earrings, necklaces, dread lock accessories, clip in hair feathers and bracelets. We use a combination of leather, feathers, beads, bone and glass to create earthy, one of a kind pieces of jewellery.  We make boutique quality jewellery without the boutique price tag. Many of our earrings are all silver plated for sensitive ears. We design our jewellery to withstand the demands of festivals and day to day life and they can be hand washed and cleaned when required (including the feathers!). General price range: $10-50\n\nPackaging\nAll products have the bare minimum of packaging to reduce waste. Jewellery and feather hair extensions are attached to a business card so customers can contact us in future. We sell the headdresses and hatbands usually with no packaging as the customers usually want to wear them then and there. If not, we package them in  recycled brown bags\n\nStall theme \nWe like the products to be the feature so our stall has quite a sleek, classic black and white theme so the products and colours really pop. We keep it as open planned as possible so it can handle the crowds. Products are hanging on the walls and are displayed on tables and are within reach of all ages and heights.\n\nCustomers\nOur customers range in age, from 4-80. We attract mostly female but have been attracting more male customers too. The young girls (4-12) really love our bright coloured and tie dyed feather options. We price our range to suit pocket money budgets and prices that parents and grandparents are happy to pay. As they as quite young, parents are usually happy to put feathers rather than hair dye in their children''s hair. Parents also like how durable they are and that they can be easily removed at home. Teens like both our natural and colourful options. They normally have a bit more to spend so we have ranges that suit their budgets and tastes. They enjoy the value of the products as they last for so long. Women in the 20s and 30s like our natural and colourful feather bundles as well as our earrings, jewellery and feather headdresses and hat accessories. They are quite fond of our boho/gypsy/festival style. Women in their 40s and 50s tend to be a bit more conservative with their colour choices so we make lots of different natural options for them to choose from so they still look mature and professional at work. They usually buy short earrings for themselves and the longer earrings and clip in feathers for presents. Women in their 60s and onwards are generally more self expressed. We attract the self expressed ladies with awesome edgy hair cuts and a great zest for life. We have shorter bright feather options for them. Women with grey hair are very attracted to feathers as they add a little something to brighten up their hair without having to dye it. As our range of hair feathers is so extensive with over 50 different options and styles, we attract quite a wide range of customers; from conservative to fully self expressed, fashionistas, young and older, long hair and short hair, professional business people to gypsy travellers. We try and have something for everyone. We have quite a range of more "male orientated" colours and styles for men and boys who would like feathers in their hair too.\n\nPrevious events\nWe have been trading with Craft Markets Australia for over 2 years and at the St Kilda Esplanade market for almost a year. We are permanent traders at both. We have been greatly accepted at St Kilda as our product mix really suits the people who live and visit St Kilda on weekends. We will be trading this summer at the trendy Queen Victoria Night Market that will be running on Wednesday evenings over summer. We will also be trading at Earthcore in December, a 4 day electronic music festival that attracts around 18 000 attendees. \n\n\n \n\n', 'Marquee', '3m x 3m Standard Site', 'market_stall_photo44image.jpg', '\n	Pedestrian Flow Zone - $298.70 per Standard Site\n	I want to be considered for a corner site within my requested zone type: Yes', 'Single coloured or natural feather  (including installation):$10-$15Single feather tie dyed (including installation):$15Feather braid (including installation:$20-$40Short feather bundle (3-5 feathers)(including installation):$20-30Long bundle of 3 feathers  (including installation):$25Long bundle of 5 feathers  (including installation):$40Feather earrings :$20-$30Clip in feathers:$20-$50Feather hat band :$20-50Feather necklace :$25-$60Feather headdress:$50-$250Other jewellery:$10-$60', 'I do not required marquee hire', 'I do not require power $0', 'N/A', '', '22nd day of October, 2014 by Jessica Flude', 'Yes', 'I will not obstruct the pedestrian pathway around the trading site.\n	I will ensure that either the service counter/bench/display height of my outlet is no greater than 900mm or special assistance is provided to each customer that may require accessibility assistance.\n	I will ensure EFTPOS machines have an extension cord or operate wirelessly so as people with accessibility requirements are not disadvantaged.\n	I will ensure that entrance and exit points of my site are completely accessible to all customers.', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'Yes'),

Participants must race across the gaming area to find clues and evidence which point to the captured bird’s location and prove the dodgy dealings behind a corrupt companies activities. The first team to solve all the puzzles which ultimately provide the key to the bird’s release win a bird related prize!\n\nThe game happens in three stages:\n\n1. Players are introduced to Rose Dudcott, a former employee of a shady company that is capturing animals for gruesome purposes. Rose is an avid bird watcher and has noticed that the male of a rare species of bird has gone missing. For this initial stage, we need a large room / space (preferably indoors) where Rose can meet and greet players. This is also effectively a ''base'' where players can revisit over the course of the game to ask Rose for help. Players then make ID cards with Rose to get past the company ''security'' (in the form of stewards, of which we''d need 2 (min) to 5 people).\n\n2. Players are then asked by Rose to go and find the location of the missing male bird by gathering information from 3 maps (and map keys) spread out across the playing area (which Rose will define by giving out maps to players). Once players have found his location, she will ask players to come back to her with the information. We need another, separate space in the town with a lockable door (that we can control) in order to house our captured male bird (preferably not too far from the original base). On this door, there will be a sign saying ''password required''.\n\n3. Players return to Rose, who gives them their final task: to find and collect 10 memos as evidence to incriminate the company and retrieve the password to free the male bird. Players must encourage the male bird back to Rose to win.\n\nThe team who frees the male bird first wins a small prize.

But Rebetika''s subject matter also extends to other subjects: romance and passion, social matters, people (such as the mother and other family), death, the difficulties of living in a foreign country, army life, war, trivial matters of everyday life, exotic places, poverty, labor, illnesses, and the minor sorrows of people.', 'n/a', 'n/a', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/rebetikamusicmelb/videos', 'n/a', 'n/a', 'I originally started playing Rebetika at the age of 12 – i had started to learn Baglama- My initial exposure to this music was from the famous cult SBS TV series "To Minore tis Avgis",a TV series based loosely around the Rebetiko era in Piraeus in the 1930s.

', 'Rappers who produce are traditionally an oddity in hip-hop. The scales of greatness can either tip towards prowess behind the MPC or the microphone, leading to either strong lyrics over lazy loops or weak songwriting aboard strong production. Melbourne’s Kwasi is one of the rarities who maintains balance between beatmaking and flowblasting. Priding himself as an artist who bends the rules, Kwasi instead creates a sonic soundscape where he fuses electronic atmospheres with boom-bap textures, blended with a deep smooth cadence and charismatic delivery. Born in Melbourne as Benjamin Martin Karikari-Yeboah, Kwasi’s musical tastes were influenced by his Ghanian father’s. Raised in a smoky studio under the mentorship of his uncle, a musician and engineer, Kwasi developed an intimate relationship with composition and production after first being exposed to the genres of funk, soul & reggae. Kwasi found inspiration within the melodic rap singing and rolling bass-lines of American West Coast hip-hop and groups like OutKast, but Kanye West was the example of a beatmaker and rapper who proved that one could juggle both art forms without dropping one to favor the other. Kwasi’s deepest influence however wasn’t musical, but came from his bed, as Kwasi suffered from hallucinations during his sleep since childhood. His night terrors became his artistic obsession, but instead of running from his fears, he harvested them, allowing his vivid subconscious to provide inspiration for his production and lyrics. Originally a country boy, Kwasi recently moved to the big smoke and already shadows over Melbourne’s nightlife. His performing career in the country began with playing support for Australian beatsmith. M-Phazes and perhaps Melbourne was not ready for Kwasi as his first gig in the city, although at the humble location of a pizza shop, ended in a brawl. But despite rocky beginnings, Kwasi persisted and has since performed alongside close friend Epps with an array of artists including Yelawolf, 360, Xzibit, Louie Knuxx, Home Brew & Hopsin. Soon to release his debut EP Strange Dreams on the label Midnight Green, Kwasi is navigating his journey with both eyes closed and his mind wide open, proving that both nightmares and dreams can come true.', '', '', 'Neither', 'No', 'No', 'No', 'No', 'Cheque', 'Kwasi', 'soundslikekwasi@gmail.com', 'Benjamin Karikari-Yeboah', '6 Alfred Street North Melbourne, Victoria, Australia', '', '2014-09-27 03:20:03'),

Emmyâ€™s sound? Think Regina Spektor meets Feist and indi pop songs about desperate women really big ghosts losing loved ones and being poor.  Honest humorous & beautiful.  Emmy loves to write music that makes people happy.  She is currently and has played past gigs around Melbourne including local venues such as Veludo''s Elwood Lounge etc whilst preparing for her full band 8-date East Coast Tour in November (see her website for details).  What''s next?  Second single release and tour in February/March 2012 followed by an international tour of Asia in late 2012.  Exciting!Produced by Aria nominated producer Jimi Maroudas (Eskimo Joe Birdie Blackman) & Benjamin McCarthy (Pete Murray Kate Miller-Heidke) the album is of high quality - songwriting and production.

We use special spice rubs to act as a marinade before cooking. We mop the meat during the cooking process with flavoured sauces to add more flavour and to retain and enhance the natural moistness of the meat. And finally "Smokin Barrys" uses aromatic woods to add a smokey flavour to their meats.

Good friends great music and perfect weather and  a REAL COCONUT shared between friends as the sun slowly sets on another glorious day.Real Palms bamboo frontage all wood benches a hammock at the back hanging coconut juice cartons and happy staff who are just nuts about coconuts.All our young green coconuts are CHEMICAL FREE (the only ones available in Australia so far) are tapped on demand which means they are cold and as fresh as can be. When you''ve emptied your coconut of its life giving juice one of our friendly staff will gladly split them so that you can savour the young coconut jelly packed with as much goodness as the coconut water itself.For those who prefer their coconuts 100% organic not just for flavour but also sustainability we offer the only ORGANIC and COLD STERILISED (patented) packaged coconut water available world wide.

Aclara Health is also actively supporting a pilot coconut plantation which will be owned and operated by an indigenous community on Cape York. This project will eventually expand to other communities and provide sustainable employment food beverages and bio diesel for indigenous people on the cape.As part of our effort to achieve sustainability we have a coconut drop off box where patrons can return their finished coconuts.

A familiar yet different four piece rock n roll band it is happy to fly in many musical directions from rock n roll to rockabilly to folk and blues and back again. The Parrot is a unique bird in todays musical landscape. All its members sing and are seasoned musicians who have played for years and have the scars to prove it. The versatility of the band has enabled it to draw a small but dedicated following that slowly grows with each performance.Live work is what this band is all about at and their blend of melodies harmonies and a tight rhythm section have enabled them to play regularly with very good reviews from their audiences. Some liken their cameraderie and presence on stage with Crowded House. As one drunken pundit put it recently at the Palace " real music...nobody plays that shit anymore. F!@king grouse"! A more credible and indeed sober review came from Mr Jeff Consi an in demand US session drummer touring with Extreme''s Nuno Bettencourt who says that "you got some really good tunes there". Jeff liked it so much he agreed to play on the new album! GREEN PARROT has played all over Melbourne and started playing interstate recently. This band is on the up and the strong single One Man WomanThe biggest gig yet was at Revolver but they have also played at: The Palace Camberwell Eltham Hotel Hardimans at Kensington Ruby''s Belgrave The Brunswick Hotel and the Empress among others. The bands  favourite local venue is the Elwood Lounge. It plays here regularly with great crowd support and it is considered among the the band to be the "home game" venue....The single One Man Woman was recently released and is available through iTunes Amazon and a host of other digital avenues.

Donnie (The Ramblers Merri Creek Pickers) was added on drums Nat Vigo on bass Sam Hall on guitar and back-up vocals. Owen left the band temporarily to focus on his own project but since the release of the â€˜Ten Cent Pistols EPâ€™ has rejoined the band on Piano and Organ duties. They recorded their debut EP at the beginning of 2011 (with Tom Iansek of Big Scary) and launched it to a packed crowd at The Workers Club in June. The self-titled EP has since been getting rave reviews being described as â€œsensationalâ€ and â€œterrificâ€. One reviewer said that â€œTen Cent Pistols have a sound that makes you wanna grow your hair long get ripped and do the helicopterâ€ Buzz Magazine said that the opening track â€˜Come Along With Meâ€™ is â€œone of the best damn tracks you are likely to hear this yearâ€ and one reviewer went so far to say that the EP is â€œa reminder of Oasis back in their glory daysâ€. Nonetheless Ten Cent Pistols are currently bringing their â€œblend of classic blues rock with a tinge of psychedeliaâ€ to bars around Melbourne with a national tour currently in the works to promote their new single that comes out later this year and another EP already in the works. Keep an eye out for Ten Cent Pistols as they may be playing on a stage near you in the very near future~What are your band\\''s website, facebook, twittter, blog etc addresses - please add all you have so we can help promote you~myspace.com/thebeatbros~Would you like the chance to play The Push stage in 2012?~No~Fee Exempt~No~', 101036),

The band had been slowly growing in popularity since their formation back in 2008 using the music sharing website: Jango as their predominant platform for online distribution with over 700 fans from all over the world; from Canada to Switzerland and even Turkey. Lead singer Brandon Davey lead guitarist Mark Dodson and Bassist Ivan Blacket had already started jamming together when they studying music at the Bellarine Secondary College so it only seemed natural to take these jam sessions to the public and with the incorporation of the drum stylings of Daniel McKoy Mischievous Thom was set onto the world.Even when Mischievous Thom was in its infancy; it had already claimed second place and first place at many local band competitions only to be superseded by earning the prestigious â€œBest Street Musicianâ€ prize at the Apollo Bay Music Festival 3 years in a row. The band has described its genre of music as alternative soft rock drawing inspiration from bands such as Radiohead Nirvana and Red Hot Chilli Peppers. With such fantastic muses at their fingertips itâ€™s no wonder that Mischievous Thom has already recorded and released a full length album with 15 songs titled â€œKindness in Redâ€ that draws similarities with REM Modest Mouse and Coldplay. Mischievous Thom can also be found busking on the streets of Melbourne and Geelong; sharing their sound with the general public as well as performing in venues such as the Bended Elbow in Geelong and the Noise Bar in Fitzroy. â€œExcited about our new sound and eager to discover where music will take usâ€ Mischievous Thom went on a short tour around various parts of Victoria in the summer of last year and are now back writing new songs with plans for recording new album later this year hopefully to be released early in 2012.~What are your band\\''s website, facebook, twittter, blog etc addresses - please add all you have so we can help promote you~~Would you like the chance to play The Push stage in 2012?~No~Fee Exempt~No~', 0),

Incorporating toe tapping grooves heart-wrenching stick throws and blisteringly fast hand speed the drumline can perform either staticly on a stage or moving through a crowd and popping up to quickly create hotspots of activity and keep and audience captivate. Using a stage we can bring in rigs of instruments and develop complex floor movements and formations while moving through the crowd we can get the audience involved and even get them to have a play!The drumline are unlike any other group in australia combining the amazing skills required for precision drumming with the showmanship that only performers as experienced as ours can bring to the table.For this event we would look at starting the show with a snare drum solo on the stage incorporating visuals and speed before having the rest of the drumline march through the crowd playing a groove to get everyone dancing! We can give member of the audience a stick or two to have a bash along on a cowbell to get them involved before continuing on to the stage. We would then play a 30min or so show that will feature all the different sections of the drumline incorporate extensive visual and movements and get the audience involved with some call and answer type interaction.If a longer show is needed we can incorporate Japanese Taiko Drums and African percussion to add greater colour and depth to the show and keep the audience entertained.One of the keys of our performance is that we are highly adaptable. We can create an entire show ourselves or work closely with the desires of the event organisers to achieve their goal. ~Would you like to be considered for Live N Local, Festival Sunday, or both?~Both Live N Local and Festival Sunday~List two referees and their phone numbers - referees must be able to vouch for quality and standards of similar events you have previously held (Not required if your event has previously been held at St Kilda Festival)~Mike Minear - Head of Marketing OTEK Australia/The Handling House AustraliaMike Minear <MMinear@otek.com.au>Nate Flagrant - Artist Manager (incl.

We are essentially a small scale marching band (unless african and taiko instruments are used) who are completely mobile and have very little impact on our surrounds. The greatest risk faced from our performance is the volume of our group.

Takoyaki consists of diced seafood (choice of octopus or prawn) & finely-diced cabbage in a savoury batter shaped into balls & drizzled with sauces & garnished with seaweed flakes & dried bonito shavings (smoky in flavour). Taiyaki is a sweet cake shaped like a fish (means ''good fortune'') with a sweet filling (red bean chocolate or custard). Our food stall is registered with the Hobsons Bay City Council. We have so far participated at the Mooncake Festival 2011 & Flavours of Melbourne 2011 both were held at the Queen Victoria Market & the Box Hill Moon Festival 2011. The food is made freshly & quickly in front of the customer & served hot. Our food is unique & visually-appealing. The cooking process is also visually-appealing â€“ customers would see batter being poured into moulds the fresh ingredients being added & the food is turned or pressed into shape & cooked. I believe our stall would add to the festivities of the St Kilda Festival & also the St Kilda Festival is a fantastic event to be a part of being beside the beach in summer & hosting many great music events!Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any queries or would like photos of the foods. Hope to hear from you soon regarding our expression of interest. Thank you.Yours faithfullyJennifer She~Have you had a stall at Yalukit Willam Ngargee or St Kilda Festival before?~No~', 0),

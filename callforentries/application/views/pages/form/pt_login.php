                	Welcome to the hub for St Kilda Festival Port Phillip Traders. Here you can apply to participate in the 2012 St Kilda Festival on Sunday 12th February, 2012. Next year the St Kilda Festival will kick off with Yalukit Willam Ngargee: People Place Gathering on Saturday 4th February, followed by St Kilda Festival Live N Local which will incubate musical talent from around the City of Port Phillip from Sunday 5th February until Saturday 11th February. <br/>

The St Kilda Festival held on Sunday 12th February draws approximately 300,000 visitors to the City of Port Phillip. We would love you and your business to get involved and help make the 2012 St Kilda Festival a memorable one!  <br/>

Extending your outdoor trading area is a unique way to become involved in Festival Sunday. Acland and Fitzroy Street release their true vibrancy on Festival Sunday, but would see an even greater benefit with the participation of your business. With Festival Sunday alone contributing millions to the local economy in a single day, it also provides a rare opportunity to showcase your business best assets. <br/><br/>

					The St Kilda Festival Traders Kit developed specifically by the City of Port Phillip to assist you in making an application to participate in the 2012 St Kilda Festival is now available online. The kit contains all the necessary information and documentation relating to trading at the upcoming event. <br/><br/>
                    
                    
We are here to make your Festival experience an enjoyable one and if we can be of further assistance with just how you can become involved in the Festival or can offer assistance with infrastructure or operational advice, please feel free to contact us by calling 03 9209 6266 or 0434 316 784 or by email to <a href="mailto:ademel@portphillip.vic.gov.au">ademel@portphillip.vic.gov.au</a>.
